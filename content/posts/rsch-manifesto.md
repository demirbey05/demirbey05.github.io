## Introduction

As someone who has always dreamed of contributing to research, I believe that research-driven innovation is the only way to advance humanity. I'd like to prove this thesis by examining the metaverse and AI technology. While the metaverse is a product-driven innovation that provides little benefit to humanity, AI is a research-driven technology that has deeply impacted our lives. I'm writing this post in 2024, and if I evaluate the performance of these two technologies over the last five years, it's clear that AI has made significant progress, while the metaverse has been limited to selling useless NFTs. This demonstrates the importance of research for our lives and the future of humanity.

There are many problems that need to be solved through research, such as climate change and global warming.

## The Importance of Research

I hope that I've conveyed the importance of research to the reader. Let's move on to the next stage: how can we improve research and democratize it? If we examine the current state of research, it's clear that it's dominated by academic institutions. To become a researcher, you have to go through redundant steps such as getting accepted by a school, getting good grades, and paying $200 for the TOEFL exam if you're not a native speaker. I think these evaluation steps are not adapted to finding the best researcher, but rather eliminating others. I'm not mentioning the racism and other scandals that I've experienced. I'm writing this because I've exposed similar situations. I only wanted to contribute to research and focus on my studies, but I was forced to waste my time on silly exams designed to eliminate the crowd. I'm not living in the US, but in my country, the situation is similar. I just wanted to contribute to research and focus on my studies, not waste my time. So, I decided to build rsch to solve this problem. I want anyone who wants to do research to do research, even if they're not part of an academic institution.

## The Purpose of rsch

I believe that rsch can change research with the power of the internet. The best depiction of this is blog posts. I know many high-quality blog posts in software engineering that have had an incredible impact. These are not academic papers, but blog posts. What if these blog authors got funded and created their own research teams? Wouldn't that increase the quality of their posts? I also got this idea when I saw a comment on HackerNews:

Exactly. Even if we can't attend an academic institution due to reasons beyond our control, we should still be able to do our best. Maybe with rsch, we can bypass silly steps and get accepted into an academic institution or continue with rsch.

## Specifications of rsch

I think I've explained why we need rsch, which is a platform for advancing research. I created specifications for rsch by thinking about the benefits of being part of an academic institution. I believe that academic institutions will eventually integrate rsch into their systems. The benefits of academic institutions are:

- Providing funding for research materials
- Connecting you with amazing people who can do amazing things
- Funding research-related expenses, such as travel to conferences
- Providing prestige that makes you trustworthy
- I mainly thought about these benefits. If I missed anything, please let me know. I designed rsch to comply with these benefits.

Academic institutions can also benefit from rsch. I know from my undergrad days that the biggest issue is finding funding for research. In my country, only a single government entity can fund you. You have to be accepted by this entity. If you live in a third-world country, it's possible that the controller is someone who is not proficient in science. Academic institutions can use rsch to find talented researchers and get funded.

## Funding

I'm not planning to implement funding for the demo, as adding a money component to your app makes it appealing to hackers, and I don't think I can handle security myself. Maybe after finding some good guys who can contribute to rsch, I'll provide high-level security for the money stuff. For funding, I'm relying on the good guys in the community. rsch will be a non-profit platform, and I think that if you want to have a better future for yourself and your children, you can donate a small amount to projects that make a good impact. I'm planning to employ crowdfunding and other mechanisms for funding. Users can look at projects and fund the ones with real potential. Each research group will have a prestige score, and I don't want someone to enter silly things and get $1M. I'll provide many data to funders to make better decisions, and funds will not be directly transferred to researchers. Instead, they'll be transferred per request and proof. I need more protection mechanisms, and I most need your contributions in that feature.

## Specifications of rsch

Assume you're a software developer working on a full-time job and seeing AI disrupt the world. You're feeling a desire to be part of such a revolution, but you can't drop your job. You need to pay your bills, maybe your son's school expenses. rsch can take a role here. I'm not saying drop your job and start research, and you'll get funds. I won't fund you; the community will fund you, so you have to prove yourself to the community and impress them. You can start doing some part-time research preparation (self-study, Coursera, edX) and start with small projects with small or no funds. Then, maybe after some time, you can create your own research group and drop your job. The all responsibility and decision are yours. rsch's mission is to meet potential researchers with someone who wants to fund these guys to create a positive impact. Maybe this research track will make you employable by big companies or institutions, or maybe they'll fund you through our platform, who knows.

From this scenario, we can say that rsch should have:

- A project or research idea proposal feature
- An academic trust metric that tracks the performance of researchers and credibility
- After some academic trust, you can set your own group and get talented guys to your group
- You can apply to research groups
- Provide best data to funders to provide appropriate funding
- Safe fund transfer mechanism, not transferring all money to researchers directly

Researchers should have the following responsibilities:

- Researchers should clearly provide a budget and how this budget will be used
- Researchers should report the research track honestly to funders
- Researchers should publish the end product (paper, software, etc.) open-source
