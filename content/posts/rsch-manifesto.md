## Introduction
Hello everyone, 

I am writing this post to explain what is **rsch** and its purpose. Let me start with myself, I have been always dreaming to contribute research maybe being a researcher. I think that research-driven innovation is the only way to advance humanity. I can also prove this thesis by looking metaverse and AI technology. Metaverse is the product-driven innovation, I think it does not provide any benefit to humanity except fun, whereas AI is research-driven technology. I am writing this post on 2024 and If I think last 5 years, these two technologies are the trend. Today, if I evaluate these two techs' performance, the metaverse did not go further than selling useless NFTs while AI changes our lives deepenly in many ways. I will use AI for fixing the grammar of this paragraph. If you think how AI evolved you will clearly see the role of research. That shows the importance of research for our lives and future of humanity. There are also tons of problems that waiting for be solved by research, such as climate change and global warming.


Sounds good, I hope that I conveyed why research is important to reader, let's move to next stage : how can we improve research and democratize ? If we think current state of the research, we can clearly see that research is dominated by academic instutions. If you want to be a researcher, you have to pass the redundant steps such as getting accepted by school, getting good grades, paying $200 to TOEFL if not native speaker, study for GRE exam. I think evaluation steps are not adapted for finding best researcher rather eliminating someone . I am not mentioning even racism and other silly scandals. I am writing this because I exposed same situations. I only wanted to contribute humanity and research, while I have research paper, instutions required me to pass silly exams that designed for eliminating the crowd. I am not seeing this steps are part of my contribution process rather seeing as waste of time. I am not living in US but in my country situation is like that. I just wanted to contribute research and only focus on my study not silly things and not wasting my time, so I decided to build **rsch** to solve this problem, I want that anyone who wants to do research should do research even if not be a part of any academic institution. Sure, you have to be part of academic institution but its should not be obligatory because we are good guys and want to advance humanity.

I believe **rsch** can change the research with the power of internet. The best depiction of that is blog posts, I know many high quality blog posts in software engineering which has incredible impact. These are not academic papers, only blog posts. What if these blog authors got funded and also created their team to do research. Isn't increases the quality of their posts. I also got this idea when I saw this comment at HackerNews :

Exactly. Even if we can't attend the academic institution because of reasons we cannot control, we should still can do our best, maybe with this efforts we can pass silly steps and got accepted to academic institute or continue with **rsch**.

I think I explained why we need **rsch**, it is the platform for advancing the research. I created specifications of **rsch** by thinking that benefits of being part of academic instution. I believe some day, academic instutions will integrate **rsch** to their systems. The benefits of academic institution : 
-	Can provide funding to get required materials for the research.
-	Can make meet you amazing people who can do amazing things.
-	Can fund your research related expenses such as travel to conference.
-	Can provide you prestige makes you trustable.

I mainly thought things the above. If I missed something let me know. I designed **rsch** such that comply all things above.

Also academic institutions can benefit from **rsch**. I know from my undergrad days, the biggest issue is finding fund your research. In my country, only single government entity can fund you. You have to be accepted by this entity, if you live in third world country, it is possible to the controller being a someone who not proficient in science. Academic institutions can use **rsch** to get talented researchers and also got funded.

In terms of funding, I am not planning to implement for demo, because if you put some money component to your app, this makes your app appealing to hackers and I do not think that I can handle security myself, maybe after finding some good guys who can contribute **rsch** to provide high level security money stuff. For funding,  I am relying on the good guys in community. **rsch** will be non-profit platform, and I think if you are someone who want to have better future for yourself and your children, you can donate small amount to projects you believe make good impact. I am planning to employ crowdfunding and other mechanisms for funding. The users can look at the projects and can fund the project who has real potential. Also each research group will has some prestige score, I do not want to someone enter silly things and got 1M$, so I will provide many data to funders to decide better, and funds are not directly transferred to researcher rather it will be transferred per request and proof. I need more protection mechanisms, I most need your contributions in that feature. 

## Specifications of rsch

Assume you are software developer working on full-time job and seeing AI is disrupting the world and each time you opened HackerNews you are seeing amazing models, stuffs. You are feeling a desire to be a part of such a revolution, but you cannot drop your jobs, you need to pay your bills maybe your son's school expense, **rsch** can take role in here. I am not saying drop your job and start research and you will get funds. I will not fund you, the community will fund you so you have to prove yourself to community also you should impress to community. You can start doing some part-time research preparations(self-study,Coursera,edX) and start with small project with small or no funds. Then maybe after some time you can create own research group and drop your jobs. The all responsibility and decision is yours **rsch** 's mission is to meet potential researcher with someone who wants to fund these guys to create positive impact, maybe this research track make you employable by big companies or institutions, maybe they will fund you through our platform who knows.

From the scenario we can say that **rsch** should have :
- Some project or research idea proposal feature
- Some academic trust metric which tracks the performance of researcher and credibility.
- After some academic trust, you can set your own group and get talented guys to your group.
- You can apply research groups.
- Should provide best data to funder to provide appropriate funding.
- Safe fund transfer mechanism, not transferring all money researcher directly.

Researcher should have following responsibilities:
- Researcher should clearly provide budget and how this budget will be used.
- Researcher should report the research track honestly to funders.
- Researcher should publish the end product(paper, software,..etc) open source
